            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I’m an author, and writing has always been one of my greatest passions.

I recently completed the first installment of my new series, The Sage of Time. This book, The Midnight Heir, is just the beginning of what I hope will become a long-running series—one that you’ll soon find on bookshelves and digital storefronts everywhere!

To help make that dream a reality, I’d love for you to check out a sample of my book by clicking the link below after reading the blurb. If you enjoy it, please share it with others and keep an eye out for The Midnight Heir on Amazon once it’s published!

            <p>I’ve been running a thriving and active Discord community since February 2024, and I couldn’t be prouder of the incredible space we’ve built.

As the server owner, I’m grateful to be part of such a diverse, vibrant, and welcoming community (in more ways than one—trust me, you’ll see!). Here, everyone is welcome—no matter your race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation—as long as you’re here to vibe, game, and connect with others.

Our community revolves around gaming, social discussions, modding, furries, LGBTQ+ pride, and, of course, a heavy focus on Midnight Club. Plus, we’re lucky to have  two special guests—OneDeep AKA Self Minded, and Almighty Pear, both legends in the Midnight Club community, hanging out with us!

Oh, and for a little extra fun, I even created my own GitHub bot, “The Gay Police”, to troll the server when someone says something sus (don’t cancel me—I’m a pansexual guy, it’s all in good fun!).

There’s something for everyone here, and my goal is to keep growing and making this space even better. So come check it out and make yourself at home!

            <h2>Tech Corner</h2>
            <p>My passion for technology started the moment I picked up a PlayStation 2 controller.

I was fascinated by how a machine could mimic real life at my fingertips—how did it know that moving the joystick meant I wanted the car to turn? Or that selecting a Dodge Charger would render a model that looked just like the real thing? That curiosity ignited my passion for hardware and software, leading me to explore everything from programming and AI development to building high-performance computers, refurbishing game consoles, and creating custom modifications.

Technology has been an integral part of my life from an early age, and I’m grateful for the opportunities it has given me. Now, I’m dedicated to applying my skills to new projects, innovations, and collaborations in the tech world.

            <h2>Food for Thought</h2>
            <p>I'I’m someone who constantly questions the world around me.

I’ve always been curious about why certain things are considered acceptable in one society but not in another. Why do some groups behave the way they do? Why do some communities struggle to coexist while others thrive? To me, not questioning the world around you is a fate worse than death—because without open dialogue, progress is impossible.

I believe in the power of hard conversations—discussing our differences, challenging societal norms, and working toward meaningful change. In Merced County, I was a strong advocate for policy reform in the school system, pushing for change at the administrative level to prevent further prejudice and break the cycle that often sets minority students on a path of systemic criminalization.

That same drive fuels my passion for sociology, and I love sharing my thoughts and insights with others. If you’re interested in reading my perspectives, check out my sociology blog below, where I post monthly on various topics. Let’s start the conversation!

            <p>A **high-energy, time-bending racing short story** set in the world of **Fast & Furious meets Midnight Club**.</p>

            <p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>

                "Ayo, hold up—what the hell is that?"<br>

            </blockquote>

            <p>🏁 Read the full story below:</p>
            <p>
                Ayo, hold up—what the hell is that?"

Tej’s voice boomed through the crowd as I rolled up to the starting line. The Miami heat shimmered over the asphalt, neon lights flickering off the polished hood of my 2008 Dodge Charger, beat thumping, and my 22’s shinning harder than the underglow on most of the rides around here. My foot tapped the gas lightly, the alien-modified 1,000-horsepower engine growling deep like a beast waiting to be let loose.

Next to me, Brian O’Conner sat in his skyline-blue Nissan Skyline GT-R, cool as ever behind his shades. On the other side, Suki revved her pink Honda S2000, while a fourth driver in a heavily-modded RX-7 stared at me like I didn’t belong here.

And maybe I didn’t.

I was 3 years too early.

Tej stepped in front of my car, squinting at the Dodge Charger badge. He rubbed his chin, then turned to the crowd. "This is 2003. Ain’t no Chargers in production. This man’s either got a one-off prototype or he’s lying his ass off."

Brian leaned forward, finally taking a good look. “Yo, he’s right. The closest thing to this is the 1999 prototype, but this ain't even that bro.”

I swallowed. Crap.

Think fast, Jordan.

I cleared my throat. “Uh… it’s an import?”

Suki smirked. “From where? The future?”

Laughter rippled through the crowd, but I kept my hands on the wheel, focusing. Doesn’t matter. Let them talk. Let them underestimate me.

Tej sighed, rubbing his temples. "Man, I swear, if that thing starts hoverin’ mid-race, I’m out."

I grinned. "No flying. Just racing."

He rolled his eyes and lifted his arms. “Alright, drivers—on my go!”

The flag girl strutted to the center, raised both hands. The engines roared—Brian’s inline-six whining, Suki’s turbocharged four-cylinder screaming.

And mine? A deep, throaty growl, alien tech thrumming under the hood, waiting.

The flag dropped.

And we launched.


Brian got the holeshot, his GT-R blasting off the line, AWD gripping hard. The RX-7 kept pace, Suki’s S2000 pulling slightly behind.

I held back—just a bit. Let them think I was slow. Let them feel confident.

Then—Shift Boost.

I dropped from 5th to 4th, twisted the wheel slightly, and let the alien-grade suspension do its thing. The Charger fishtailed perfectly, catching just enough kinetic force to slingshot me forward.

BOOM.

I rocketed past the RX-7 like it was parked. The driver’s head snapped toward me, eyes wide.

Suki yelped. “What the hell?! Where’d he come from?!”

The first sharp turn loomed ahead. Brian braked hard, his Skyline smoothly transitioning into a drift. The RX-7 and S2000 followed suit, rear ends sliding out, tires screeching.

But me?

I had Cheat Codes.

I didn’t brake.

Instead, I flicked the wheel and engaged Shift Boost again—dropping gears mid-drift. The Charger’s alien suspension handled it like a damn Corvette, gripping hard while still sliding.

The move shouldn’t have worked. A normal Charger—hell, even a modded one—would’ve skidded straight into the barrier. But mine?

It hugged the turn like it was born for it.

Tej’s voice crackled over the radio. “Yo, somebody tell me how a two-ton muscle car just took that corner like a damn Porsche?!”


We hit the straightaway. Quarter-mile left.

Brian was still ahead, but barely. His GT-R’s twin turbos screamed, pushing 600+ HP. His car was fast. But mine?

Mine was reality-breaking.

The Glitch Boost was ready.

5-second window. If I activated it now, I’d teleport to where I’d be five seconds ahead, assuming constant speed.

I braced myself, adjusted my grip, and—

Glitch Boost: Activated.

The world blurred. The neon skyline of Miami fractured for a millisecond, like reality itself had a frame drop. The Charger glitched forward—not teleporting, but skipping space, like a game lagging ahead of its opponent.

In an instant, Brian’s Skyline was behind me.

“…What the—?!”

The crowd lost their minds.

Suki’s jaw dropped. The RX-7 guy slammed his hands on the wheel, cursing. Tej straight-up threw his headset.

And Brian?

He could only watch as I crossed the finish line first.


I skidded to a stop, tires smoking. The crowd swarmed, shouting, laughing, hyping up the mystery Charger from nowhere.

Brian pulled up next to me, shaking his head, sunglasses lowered. “Alright, man. I gotta ask—where’d you get that thing?”

I smirked. "Told you. It’s an import."

Tej stomped over, still glaring at my Dodge Charger badge. “Nah, nah, nah. Ain’t no way. That ain’t stock.”

I shrugged. “It’s got some… mods.”

Suki folded her arms, suspicious. “Uh-huh. Right. And I bet you just ‘found’ those mods lying around, huh?”

Brian leaned closer, staring at the car like he was trying to solve a puzzle. “Whatever it is, it ain’t street legal.”

I patted the dash. "Neither is time travel, but here we are."

Brian laughed. “Alright, man. Whatever you say.” He tossed me a set of folded bills. “You won. But next time, no disappearing acts.”

I pocketed the cash, grinning. "No promises."

I threw the Charger into gear, revved the alien-built engine one last time, and peeled off into the Miami night—a legend that shouldn’t exist, in a car that never was. 

This might be erased from time when I leave, but I'm gonna enjoy the moment now.
